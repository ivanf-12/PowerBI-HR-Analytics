# PowerBI HR Analytics Dashboard Project
### Introduction
In this project, we are given an excel file named "Attendance Sheet 2022-2023_Masked", which is a masked version of real company attendance data from April 2022 - June 2022. We are going to create a powerBI dashboard to help answer some of the questions that the HR have. We will also provide additional insights.  
### Objectives
- To understand working preference of people
- Percentage of sick leave
### Tools
- PowerBI
### Insights
- Overall, the lowest percentage of WFH is on Tuesday(8.11%) and the highest is on Friday(13.01%)
- Between the three months, the highest sick leave percentage is on May(1.68%)
- Overall, the lowest presence percentage is on May 
### Recommendations
- Company could do resource saving, maintenance, etc on Friday, because of high WFH percentage. Company could also target company bonding activities, etc on Thursday when there are the most employee working from the office
- Company should check the cause of high sick leave percentage on May. Is it because of a disease, etc. By then, company could consider preventive action for the next year to reduce sick leave percentage(example: giving out flu shots to employee before May)
- Company should check the cause of low presence percentage on May, is it because of some event, etc. By then, company could take some action. For example, if the cause of low presence percentage on May is employee taking vacation, company could give bonus for employee that work during this period of time
